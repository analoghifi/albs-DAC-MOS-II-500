albs DAC-MOS-II 500 audio power amplifier module (mono single channel)  
using double die lateral MOSFETs
* Balanced audio input (unbalanced input possible as well)  
* fully DC-coupled  
* Bridge Mode (BTL) possible (using two modules) resulting in multiple power and double slew rate, no matter if a balanced or unbalanced input is used (without the need of additional circuits)  
* With inverting control via input B, an active control circuit (feedback) for loudspeakers is possible.  
* 6dB-filters (C<sub>HA</sub>, C<sub>HB</sub>, C<sub>TA</sub>, C<sub>TB</sub>) can be used as crossover for tweeter, woofer or midrange. This means that no additional crossover is required to activate loudspeaker cabinets with 1st order filters.  
* A mono mixer amplifier can be realised via inputs B and C (e.g. as a final stage for mono sub-bass).  
* With the resistor R<sub>VU</sub> any gain from 0 to +3.6dB can be set. (With unbalanced control via input A, B connected to M).  
* Via the resistors R<sub>VA</sub>, R<sub>VB</sub>, R<sub>VC</sub> as well as R<sub>TA</sub> and R<sub>TBC</sub> almost any input resistance can be realised. The input sensitivity of the module can also be freely selected via integrated voltage dividers. (R<sub>VA</sub>, R<sub>VB</sub> are series resistors, R<sub>TA</sub>, R<sub>TBC</sub> are divider resistors).  
* The preamplifier is fully balanced with a high-quality op amp from Burr-Brown (in metal case TO-99) and is insensitive to temperature influences and mechanical shocks. It is also decoupled from the operating voltages and protected against reverse polarity.  
* An extremely linear current mirror driver operates in Class A mode and is cooled by 2 finned heat sinks.  
* The composite pre- and driver stage can be supplied via separate operating voltages. Since in this case the supply voltages of the pre- and driver stage are higher than those of the output stage transistors, a better modulation capability in connection with a higher signal slew rate results, while the power dissipation of the output stage transistors is reduced. The input circuit is supplied via Zener diodes.  
* The pre- and driver stage is equipped with 220µF/100V electrolytic capacitors and 0.22µF/100V film capacitors.  
* All signal affecting capacitors are foil types.  
* All operating voltage inputs and the star-wired earth connections are fitted with nickel-plated brass M4 screw bolts, the audio inputs and all other necessary connections are fitted with silver-plated pins.  
* The loudspeaker output can be tapped either via three 16 amp relays connected in parallel or directly at nickel-plated brass M4 bolts, bypassing the relays.  
* The hermetically sealed relays guarantee a long-lasting, low-impedance contact transition and a constant, high damping factor at the loudspeaker connection.  
* Overvoltage protection of the power amp transistors against voltage peaks with inductive loads is realised with fast 6 A diodes.  
* A partly completely revised, partly new protection circuit ensures immediate disconnection of the loudspeaker if internal or external faults occur. The following functions are integrated:  
    * Switch-on delay of the loudspeaker of 5 sec. to avoid switch-on noises in the loudspeaker.  
    * Immediate disconnection of the loudspeaker in case of mains failure longer than 0.3 sec. and when switching off.  
    * Shutdown if DC voltage or extreme proportions of infrasound occur in the output signal.  
    * Shutdown in case of failure of any operating voltage of preamplifier, driver or output stage.  
    * Frequency-independent, delayed shutdown when a presettable output voltage is reached (power limitation).  
    * Delay-free switch-off when a presettable switch-off point is reached in the event of oscillation, extreme HF components in the output signal or clipping. (high-frequency protection).  
    * Shutdown when the permissible temperature range of max. 90°C is exceeded at the cooling angle.  
    * The protection circuit also controls the delayed, but abrupt switch-on of the relays when the fault at the output is eliminated.  
* The PCB is made of 2.0mm FR-4 base material and coated on both sides with 70µ copper. The solder and component side have a solder mask, the component side also has a position imprint.  
* The large ground planes as well as the double-guided wide + and - supply voltage conductor tracks enable subsequent enlargement of the conductor track cross-sections as a modification by means of tin-plated cut-outs.  
* Additional modification options:  
All 4 supply voltages (±/+VTS/-VTS) can be filtered against ground with MKP capacitors (min. 4.7µF) on the solder side of the module.  
* Practical 5-pole audio input connector for all control variants.  
* For active concepts, bridge or stereo power amplifiers, the ± and ground connections can be electrically connected with spacer bolts when the modules are arranged one above the other and thus mechanically fixed.
